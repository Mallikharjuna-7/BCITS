	USERNAME = "root";
	PASSWORD = "12345";

	create an entity class and mark as @Entity

 	then go to repository- and inject EntityManagerFactory in repository
	
	@Autowired
	EntityManagerFactor factory;

	then create EntityManager to get Transactions.

	EntityManager manager = factory.createEntityManager();
	manager.getTransaction.begin();
	manager.persist(entity);
	manager.getTransaction.commit();
	manager.close();
